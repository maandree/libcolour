.SH NAME
LIBCOLOUR_YPBPR - YPbPr
.SH DESCRIPTION
YPbPr [the \(aqb\(a and the \(aqr\(aq should be in subscript and capitalised]
colours are presented with either of
.nf

	typedef struct libcolour_ypbpr_f libcolour_ypbpr_f_t;
	typedef struct libcolour_ypbpr_lf libcolour_ypbpr_lf_t;
	typedef struct libcolour_ypbpr_llf libcolour_ypbpr_llf_t;

.fi
These
.BR struct s
use
.BR float ,
.BR double ,
and
.BR long\ double ,
respecitively, for the values stored in them,
and are otherwise identical.
.B struct libcolour_ypbpr_f
is defined as
.nf

	struct libcolour_ypbpr_f {
		enum libcolour_model \fImodel\fP;
		float \fIY\fP;
		float \fIPb\fP;
		float \fIPr\fP;
	};

.fi
.I .model
shall be set to
.BR LIBCOLOUR_YPBPR .
In
.BR union\ libcolour_colour_f ,
.BR union\ libcolour_colour_lf ,
and
.BR union\ libcolour_colour_llf ,
.I .ypbpr
is used for YPbPr colours.
.P
.IR .Y ,
.IR .Pb ,
and
.I .Pr
hold the Y (luma), Pb [the \(aqb\(aq should be in
subscript and capitalised], and Pr [the \(aqr\(aq
should be in subscript and capitalised] values,
respectively.
.P
Y is 0 in black and 1 in white.
Pb is the difference between Y and blue.
Pr is the difference between Y and red.
.P
YPbPr is additive, since it is linearly isomorphic
to CIE 1931 XYZ. It's white point is the
CIE Standard Illuminant D65.
